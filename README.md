# Exploring-the-Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency-Market

Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2008, hundreds of similar projects based on the blockchain technology have emerged. We call these cryptocurrencies (also coins or cryptos in the Internet slang). Some are extremely valuable nowadays, and others may have the potential to become extremely valuable in the future1. In fact, on the 6th of December of 2017, Bitcoin has a market capitalization above $200 billion.

To better understand the growth and impact of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies you will, in this project, explore the market capitalization of different cryptocurrencies.

Warning: The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile, and any money you put in might disappear into thin air. Never invest money you can't afford to lose.
